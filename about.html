            <h2 class="title">Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Our story began on a stormy night during a hiking trip in the
              Pacific Northwest. Founders Sarah and Mike, avid adventurers
              themselves, found their expedition cut short by inadequate gear.
              Inspired by this experience, they set out to create a brand that
              ensures no adventure is hindered by the elements. Thus, RainyDays
              was born. Their vision was to develop high-quality, reliable, and
              stylish rain jackets that could withstand the harshest weather
              conditions and keep adventurers comfortable and protected.
