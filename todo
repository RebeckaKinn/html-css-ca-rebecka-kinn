- refactor css
- remove useless classes and reuse what you can

- be done with the CA report

- make changes by the feedback from WAVE 

- change the div-elements around img (maybe more) to more apropriate tags. Ex pop ups 

In header: 
* <div class="search"> => <form class="search" action="search-results.html" method="get"> ?
* <menu class="search-menu"> => <ul class="search-menu"> ?
* add <nav id="menu" role="navigation" aria-label="Main navigation"> in nav id menu ? 


In footer: 
* add <nav class="footer-menu" aria-label="Footer navigation"> in nav class footer-menu
* add adress tag instead?:
<address>
   <p>RainyDays Headquarters</p>
   <p>123 Adventure Lane, Suite 456</p>
   <p>Outdoor City, OC 78901</p>
</address>
* The contact details could be more semantically clear by using <dl> (definition list) instead of multiple <ul> elements. This helps to semantically represent the contact information.
* The social media icons can be wrapped in an unordered list for better structure, indicating that they are a list of items. 
* Make sure the heading levels are appropriate. If this is the first heading within the footer, it can remain as <h2>. If itâ€™s the only heading, consider using <h3> instead.
